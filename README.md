## Identified AWS Services in the Diagram:
S3 Buckets - Likely for storage.
SNS (Simple Notification Service) - For message broadcasting.
Lambda Functions - For running serverless logic.
SQS (Simple Queue Service) - For handling message queues.
API Gateway - Handling REST API calls.

## Equivalent Azure Services:
Azure Blob Storage - Equivalent to AWS S3 for scalable object storage.
Azure Event Grid or Service Bus - Similar to SNS for event routing or message broadcasting.
Azure Functions - Equivalent to AWS Lambda for serverless computing.
Azure Queue Storage or Service Bus Queues - Equivalent to SQS for message queuing.
Azure API Management or Azure Functions Proxies - Equivalent to API Gateway for managing APIs.


1. Terraform module for an **Azure API Management** resource. Azure API Management is a service that enables you to manage, secure, and scale your APIs, acting as an API gateway. (api_management)

2. Terraform module for **Azure Blob Storage** account and a **storage container**. Azure Blob Storage is equivalent to AWS S3 and provides scalable object storage for unstructured data. (blob_storage)

3. Terraform module for **Azure Function App**. Azure Function Apps provide a serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. (function_app)

4. Terraform module for an **Azure Storage Queue**. Azure Queue Storage provides cloud messaging between application components and is equivalent to AWS SQS for message queuing. (Queue_storage)

5. Terraform module for an **Azure Service Bus Namespace** and a **Service Bus Topic**. Azure Service Bus provides reliable message queuing and is similar to AWS SNS for event routing and message broadcasting. (service_bus)

6. Terraform Code for API Management to expose Function Apps. (api_management_api)

7. Set up an Event Grid Subscription to forward events from Azure Blob Storage to Azure Service Bus. This Terraform module creates an Azure Event Grid Subscription that subscribes to blob storage events (e.g., blob creation and deletion) and sends those events to a Service Bus topic. (blob_to_servicebus)

8. This will trigger the Function App whenever a new message is available in the Service Bus topic or queue. Terraform Code for binding a Function App to Service Bus Queue/Topic (servicebus_subscription)

9. Terraform Code for Service Bus Topics and Queues. This Terraform module deploys a Service Bus Topic and Queue in an existing Service Bus Namespace. (servicebus_topic)

10. Set up Managed Identities or Service Principals to ensure each service has permission to communicate with other services securely This Terraform module assigns a specified role to a Function App for access to a Storage Account.(storage_access)

## chatgpt prompt : now as you know i have to achieve that flow diagram connection and also setup using terraform each & every resources how to communicate as per the diagram every setup using terraform, i created terraform resources of azure services and dynamic modules too that you mentioned now what should i do to achieve this
